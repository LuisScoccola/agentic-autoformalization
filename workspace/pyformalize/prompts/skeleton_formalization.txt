- What I am doing
    - I am using Lean 4 to formalize mathematics. I am doing so in the Lean project {location_of_lean_project}.

- What I want you to do
    - Formalize all the definitions and statements of results that are in the _reference_ {location_of_informal_result}.
    - Before each statement of a result, add a comment containing an informal proof of the result.

- Each statement of a result should look as follows:
/--
    [Informal description of the statement, which should be filled in by you]

    PROVIDED SOLUTION:
    [Informal proof of the statement, which can be taken from _reference_ and which should be filled in by you]
-/
theorem ResultName [Formal statement of the result, which should be filled in by you] := by sorry

- Details you should keep in mind
    - Do the formalization in a new _target file_ {formalization_file} inside the Lean project folder.
    - Have one result/definition per result/definition there and name those accordingly.
    - If there are results/definitions that are required but are not in an environment in the _reference_ still have a restul/definition in the _target file_.
    - Do not attempt to formalize proofs; instead, just use Lean's keyword sorry.
    - Use the mathlib library as a dependency, so do not formalize anything that has already been formalized there. If a result/definition follows easily from something in mathlib, make sure to instantiate it so that it matches exactly the result/definition in the _reference_.

- Your workflow
    - Edit the _target file_ and make sure it compiles.
    - Iterate using error messages if necessary.

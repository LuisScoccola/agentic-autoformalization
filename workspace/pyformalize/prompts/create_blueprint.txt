- Context
    - Math written in English consists of a series of definitions, statements, and proofs.
        - Examples of statements are the statement of a lemma, the statement of a proposition, and the statement of a theorem.
        - Some definition might be given inside a paragraph, without a definition environment, but these are still definitions.

- The REFERENCE is the file {location_of_informal_result}. The REFERENCE contains math written in English.
- The TARGET is the file {location_of_blueprint}.

- What I want you to do
    - For each definition in the REFERENCE, write
<DEFINITION> [the definition as it appears in the REFERENCE] <ENDDEFINITION>
    - For each statement in the REFERENCE, write
<THEOREM> [the statement as it appears in the REFERENCE] 
<PROOF> [the proof of the statement as it appears in the REFERENCE. leave blank if no proof is provided] <ENDTHEOREM>
    - Do this in the same order as in the REFERENCE.
